1. [X] [Introduction to Agents](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/introduction)
   - **Understanding Agents**
     - What is an Agent, and how does it work?
     - How do Agents make decisions using reasoning and planning?
   - **The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models) in Agents**
     - How LLMs serve as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù behind an Agent.
     - How LLMs structure conversations via the Messages system.
   - **Tools and Actions**
     - How Agents use external tools to interact with the environment.
     - How to build and integrate tools for your Agent.
   - **The Agent Workflow:**
     - _Think_¬†‚Üí¬†_Act_¬†‚Üí¬†_Observe_.
2. [X] [What is an Agent?](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/what-are-agents)
   - An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.
     1. The Brain (AI Model)
        - LLM (Large Language Model): e.g. GPT4 from OpenAI, LLama from Meta, Gemini from Google, ...
        - VLM (Vision Language Model)
     2. The Body (Capabilities and Tools)
   -  To summarize, an Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically a LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to
      - Understand natural language: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.
      - Reason and plan: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.
      - Interact with its environment: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.

4. [X] [What are LLMs?](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/what-are-llms)
   - [tokenizer_config.json ¬∑ HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct at main](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct/blob/main/tokenizer_config.json)
5. [X] [Messages and Special Tokens](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/messages-and-special-tokens)
   - [openai-python/chatml.md at release-v0.28.0 ¬∑ openai/openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/release-v0.28.0/chatml.md) (ChatML template format)
   - [Chat Templates](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/chat_templating#how-do-i-use-chat-templates) (`chat_template` is usually in the model's tokenizer)
   - [ü§ó Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)
6. [X] [What are Tools?](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/tools)
   - A Tool should contain:
     - A¬†**textual description of what the function does**.
     - A¬†_Callable_¬†(something to perform an action).
     - _Arguments_¬†with typings.
     - (Optional) Outputs with typings.
   - The tool description is injected in the system prompt.
     - What the tool does
     - What exact inputs it expects
7. [X] [Quick Self-Check (ungraded)](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/quiz2) (Quick Quiz 2)
8. [X] [Understanding AI Agents through the Thought-Action-Observation Cycle](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/agent-steps-and-structure)
   - Agents work in a continuous cycle of:¬†**thinking (Thought) ‚Üí acting (Act) and observing (Observe)**.
     1. **Thought**: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be.
     2. **Action:**¬†The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.
     3. **Observation:**¬†The model reflects on the response from the tool.
9. [X] [Thought: Internal Reasoning and the Re-Act Approach](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/thoughts)
   - [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) ([papers.cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2210.03629)): ‚ÄúReasoning‚Äù (Think) with ‚ÄúActing‚Äù (Act)
     - ReAct is a simple prompting technique that appends ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù before letting the LLM decode the next tokens.
     - We have recently seen a lot of interest for reasoning strategies. This is what's behind models like Deepseek R1 or OpenAI's o1, which have been fine-tuned to "think before answering".
10. [X] [Actions: Enabling the Agent to Engage with Its Environment](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/actions)
   - One key method for implementing actions is the **Stop and Parse Approach**. This method ensures that the agent‚Äôs output is structured and predictable:
     1. Generation in a Structured Format: The agent outputs its intended action in a clear, predetermined format (JSON or code).
     2. Halting Further Generation: Once the action is complete, the agent stops generating additional tokens. This prevents extra or erroneous output.
     3. Parsing the Output: An external parser reads the formatted action, determines which Tool to call, and extracts the required parameters.
   - An alternative approach is using **Code Agents**. The idea is: instead of outputting a simple JSON object, a Code Agent generates an executable code block‚Äîtypically in a high-level language like Python.
     - Expressiveness: Code can naturally represent complex logic, including loops, conditionals, and nested functions, providing greater flexibility than JSON.
     - Modularity and Reusability: Generated code can include functions and modules that are reusable across different actions or tasks.
     - Enhanced Debuggability: With a well-defined programming syntax, code errors are often easier to detect and correct.
     - Direct Integration: Code Agents can integrate directly with external libraries and APIs, enabling more complex operations such as data processing or real-time decision making.
11. [X] [Observe: Integrating Feedback to Reflect and Adapt](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/observations)
   - Observations are how an Agent perceives the consequences of its actions.
     - Collects Feedback: Receives data or confirmation that its action was successful (or not).
     - Appends Results: Integrates the new information into its existing context, effectively updating its memory.
     - Adapts its Strategy: Uses this updated context to refine subsequent thoughts and actions.
   - After performing an action, the framework follows these steps in order:
     1. Parse the action to identify the function(s) to call and the argument(s) to use.
     2. Execute the action.
     3. Append the result as an Observation.
12. [ ] [Dummy Agent Library](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/unit1/dummy-agent-library) (TODO: solve the hallucination issue)
   - [dummy_agent_library.ipynb ¬∑ agents-course/notebooks at main](https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/dummy_agent_library.ipynb) ([open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/#fileId=https://huggingface.co/agents-course/notebooks/blob/main/dummy_agent_library.ipynb)) => [Modified Version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SzN6jyQpldIXF-eNPP1_vnKv4ivLJRG7?usp=sharing)
   - The `chat` method is the RECOMMENDED method to use in order to ensure a smooth transition between models
   - If use `text_generation` method, we need to provide prompt (e.g. special tokens for the specific model) properly
